## Project Description
This project simulates a highway system with service stations and electric rental vehicles. Each station, located at a unique distance from the highway start, houses a fleet of electric vehicles, each with a specific range. A journey is a sequence of service stations where a driver stops. The goal is to plan the route with the fewest stops between two stations. If multiple routes have the same minimum stops, the route with stops at the shortest distance from the highway start is chosen.
